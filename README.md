Assignment 2 Interactive 3D Development:   
Brief Description 

The Scene starts off in his dream, there are 3 different area players will experience, a street, an alley, and his own bedroom. Player first spawns in the Streets and the player walks down the streets while picking up some notes and photos that reminds him of a familiar scene. As he collects each photo and note, he slowly remembers what he should be remembering. In the last photo he collects it shows up a wooden box which seems familiar to him like it was once precious to him. He went around finding the box and finally he saw it in a narrow alleyway. After picking up the box and wanting to open he hears a faint sound of someone crying coming from deeper within the alley. He walked in with all his confidence and saw a boy squatting down at the end of the alley covering his face. The player realises that the sound was coming from the boy and decides to approach the boy and interact with it. While trying to interact with it, the boy disappears, and he wakes up feeling there was something familiar between him and the kid and he goes around his room to search for memories to remind him of what he saw. After realising the kid was him. The player then goes back into his memories and tries to find out the memory he had once sealed away. 
Design Process
This 3D game brings players into the dream of the main character and leads them along the way to discover a scary memory the main character once had. Many people tend to seal off their memories when they see or experience something scary and terrifying in their life. Some will choose to not remember the things they once experienced but a memory will always stay as a memory, one day u will still remember it. This game is to let players realize even the scariest memories or experience can be conquered and they should not be afraid. They can use Different keys to move and look around the environment and interact with teleport points after interacting with them once.

-	Different types of interactions with items 
-	Better storyline 
-	Better space allowing players to explore more 



Technologies Used
YouTube : https://www.youtube.com/  this Platform was used to find tutorials and guides on how to model and how to use unity platform. 
Unity Assets Store: To find some assets to put in our scenes.
Testing
Modelling was tested along the way to make sure there is no N-gons so that exporting into substance will not have any issues. Uvs were done to make sure there were no reversed or Overlapping Uvs. 
Unity testing was done along the way as we coded to make sure any bugs that appeared were solved before moving onto the next one. 
How to Play 
Players interacts with the character or to pick items up: press key E
Player to move: 
Players to go to next dialogue: 
Player to interact with teleport point after exploring them once : 

Platforms to run the software.
-	Unity Hub 
Limitations and Bugs 
 Only Substance and Maya was used to complete all the models and texturing while using trim sheets. The only bugged met for modelling was when I was dealing with the rigging boy I had 4 different errors in maya which were Skin definition(3), Constraints export failed and Unsupported constraints export failed and complex animation. Other than that, the rest were because of N-gons and reversed or overlapping Uvs.
